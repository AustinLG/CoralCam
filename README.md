# CoralCam
A repository for code files used with CoralCam v3.1, a low-cost habitat monitoring camera. 
Please note that this project requires soldering. Looking for a solder-free alternative? Check out KiloCam at: https://github.com/AustinLG/KiloCam

A *slightly old* video build guide can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UbxjSf8fWUIyismeS-o7XM5HT61BGQah/view

A complete guide on programming your CoralCam can be found in the header of the code files provided in this repository.
